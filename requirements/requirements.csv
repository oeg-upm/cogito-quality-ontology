Identifier;Competency Question / Fact
QUAL-1;A project can have information resources (especially point cloud and image jobs)
QUAL-2;An element can have information resources (especially as-built point clouds and meshes), so information resources are related to elements
QUAL-3;An element can have results about its quality
QUAL-4;Quality results include defects and geometric quality information
QUAL-5;A quality result can be manually checked (status) and confirmed or not (outcome)
QUAL-6;A defect is reflected by an image job
QUAL-7;A defect has a predicted label, a confidence level, and a severity indicator
QUAL-8;An image is taken at a time, using a device with a certain position and orientation and is associated to an element 
"QUAL-9	";An image can be processed before and after being analysed
QUAL-10;Geometric quality information is obtained from a point cloud
QUAL-11;A piece of geometric quality information is related to a rule and includes a result (passed or not passed), a tolerance reference, a scalar result, a unit, a scheduled timestamp, a performed timestamp and an identifier
QUAL-12;A rule includes an identifier, an origin document, a label, a description, and keywords related to element, material and relationship types.
QUAL-13;An information resource is related to the tasks involved in its contents
